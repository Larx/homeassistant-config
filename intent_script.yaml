             Welcome to the Cats Lair.   You can activate me on either Google Home or Amazon Echo with the magic words...  my name is Alexa, so Alexa ask the house.
             You can use Turn On or Turn Off commands for these.
             Both of us can control the lights which are {%- for state in states.light %} {{ state.name }}, {%- endfor %}.
             Both of us can control power to {%- for state in states.switch %} {{ state.name }}, {%- endfor %}.
             Example - hey Google turn on the lounge light . . . . .
             There are some presets defined, you can use the keyword Activate to activate a preset.  They are {%- for state in states.scene %} {{ state.name }}, {%- endfor %}.
             
             I have an added skill; I can give you a status report, just say Hey Alexa, ask the house for a status report.

             Just ask me to ask the house for help to hear this again.
